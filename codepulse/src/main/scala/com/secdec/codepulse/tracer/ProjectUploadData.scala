	  * if it was a failure, the project will be removed from the manager. If
	  * the loading process finished successfully, the associated TracingTarget
	  * will be notified so that it can leave the 'loading' state.
	  *
	  * The goal of this is to allow users to immediately navigate to the new
	  * project page when they upload a file, without having to wait for the actual
	  * (heavy-duty) file processing logic. Simple checks should be performed on
	  * any file before processing it in this way, to avoid a useless redirect.
	  *
	  * An example:
	  * If a user uploads a huge .war file, processing may take around a minute.
	  * But since the processing is done elsewhere, the user can see that the
	  * upload itself was successful; they will see a 'loading' screen on the
	  * project page, rather than waiting for a progress bar in the upload form.
